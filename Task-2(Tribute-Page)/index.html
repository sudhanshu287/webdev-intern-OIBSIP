                            Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist,
                philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Sons. He was chairman of
                the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, and interim chairman from October
                2016 through February 2017. He continues to head its charitable
                trusts. In 2008, he received the Padma Vibhushan, the second
                highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan,
                the third highest civilian honour in 2000.

                            He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of
                Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from the
                Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree
                in architecture. He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the
                shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata's as
                chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under
                his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and
                Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group
                into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest
                philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60-65% of his
                income to charity.

                        In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.[14][15] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent.[16] Under his leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.
